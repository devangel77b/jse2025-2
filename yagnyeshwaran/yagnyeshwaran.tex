\begin{abstract}
Commvault is a cybersecurity company that provides data protection and information management software. During my internship at Commvault, I supported the company’s transition from Microsoft Teams to Slack by automating the extraction of data from the Slack API via time-triggered Azure Function Apps. Using this data, I began designing a Power BI dashboard to visually showcase the usage patterns of various Slack tools and functions, allowing the Business Development team and leadership to quantify the impact of Slack in the workspace.
