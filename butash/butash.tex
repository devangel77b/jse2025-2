\begin{abstract}
Monmouth County Engineering’s Facilities Section is responsible for the construction, maintenance, and improvement of county-owned buildings and their systems, including mechanical, electrical, plumbing, architectural, hydronic, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. During my internship with the Facilities Section, I gained hands-on exposure to underlying building systems through site visits and project reviews. My responsibilities included reviewing construction drawings, observing ongoing projects, and tracking project progress across multiple locations. Worksites included the Monmouth County Courthouse, Public Library, Correctional Institution, and various buildings within the Public Works Complex.
