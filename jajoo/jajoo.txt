Civil engineering plays a critical role in the planning, construction, and maintenance of infrastructure systems that support residential and commercial development. Watermen LLC is a civil engineering and construction firm specializing in underground utilities, site development, and water and sewer infrastructure projects. The company works closely with municipalities and private developers to ensure projects meet safety standards, environmental regulations, and engineering specifications. This internship provided me with hands-on experience in the marine and residential side of civil engineering and construction management. During my time at Watermen LLC, I gained exposure to field operations and project coordination, including site inspections,  construction documentation, and financial calculations.  This experience strengthened my understanding of how engineering plans are implemented in real-world conditions and how collaboration between engineers, contractors, and inspectors is essential for successful infrastructure projects.
