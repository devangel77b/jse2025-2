\begin{abstract}
Intravenous (IV) drips are widely used in clinical settings to maintain patient hydration and prevent complications. Although electronic IV pumps provide continuous monitoring, their high cost limits implementation in low-resource hospitals. Our low cost IV bag weight monitor device offers an affordable alternative by detecting when an IV bag reaches a low volume threshold. The device uses a single-point load cell to measure bag weight and triggers a visual LED indicator and audible buzzer when the weight falls below a preset limit. The current prototype uses a simple shelf-style structure to house the Arduino-based circuitry and display the alarm components. Registered nurses have reviewed the current prototype, deeming it a feasible and efficient alternative to more expensive IV pumps. Future work will integrate a microcontroller and a compact 3D-printed encapsulation to improve durability, reduce size, and improve overall usability.
