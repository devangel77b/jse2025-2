\begin{abstract}
Civil engineering is a field that focuses on designing, constructing, and maintaining the infrastructure and natural environment that society relies on. Civil engineers have to ensure the safety of all structures and address the concerns of any citizens. Monmouth County Engineering is a public works group that is responsible for the upkeep and development of roads, bridges, traffic signals, and buildings. The Traffic Safety Division focuses primarily on roads, signs, traffic signals, and improving road safety through analysis and design. 

This internship has allowed me to learn the daily duties and the responsibilities of civil engineers that keep the road and civilians safe. Throughout my time at Monmouth County Engineering, I was able to witness and partake in a traffic road study that allowed me to understand the process and evaluation of different analyses.
